# Sequence Alignment Notebooks

This collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrates various sequence alignment algorithms, including custom alignment, Needleman-Wunsch global alignment, and Smith-Waterman local alignment.

## Notebooks Overview

### Custom Sequence Alignment (`1002069069_CUSTOM.ipynb`)

Implements a custom sequence alignment algorithm allowing for flexible scoring schemes and gap penalties.

#### Features
- Customizable sequence alignment.
- Parameterized substitution matrix and gap penalty.

### Needleman-Wunsch Global Alignment (`1002069069_NW.ipynb`)

Provides an implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.

#### Features
- Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.
- Customizable scoring matrix and gap penalties.

### Smith-Waterman Local Alignment (`1002069069_SW.ipynb`)

Implements the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment.

#### Features
- Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment.
- Customizable scoring matrix and gap penalties.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed.
2. Download the notebooks to your local environment.
3. Open and run the desired notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Usage

Each notebook contains a `Solution` class with methods tailored to the specific alignment algorithm. These methods can be used to perform sequence alignments by providing the necessary sequences and scoring parameters.

## Running the Notebooks

Navigate to the respective notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells to see the alignment algorithms in action.
