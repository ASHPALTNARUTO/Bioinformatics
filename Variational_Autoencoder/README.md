# Bioinformatics Homework 4: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch, completed as part of a bioinformatics course assignment.

## Overview

The homework focuses on understanding and implementing the VAE architecture, which is used for unsupervised learning of complex data representations. The assignment is carried out in Google Colab, leveraging its GPU capabilities and pre-installed Python packages.

## Assignment Structure

1. **Introduction to VAE**: Explanation of Variational Autoencoder architecture, including the encoder and decoder networks, and the process of mapping input data to a latent space.

2. **PyTorch Implementation**: 
   - Setup of the framework in Google Colab.
   - Downloading and accessing the dataset.
   - Implementation of placeholders in `dataset.py`, `datamodule.py`, and `task.py` to complete the VAE model training, validation, and testing pipeline.

3. **Execution and Analysis**: 
   - Instructions to run the provided `main.ipynb` notebook after filling the placeholders.
   - Analysis of the outputs on Tensor Board to understand the model's behavior and performance.

4. **Difficulty and Learning Experience**: Reflections on the challenges faced and the time taken to complete the assignment.

## Prerequisites

- Google Colab account
- Understanding of PyTorch and neural network architectures

## Getting Started

1. Download the `vae.zip` file attached to the assignment and upload it to Google Drive.
2. Extract the files and open `main.ipynb` in Google Colab.
3. Ensure GPU access in Colab for efficient training.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to download the dataset and complete the code placeholders.

## Running the Notebook

After completing the placeholders in the code files, run all cells in `main.ipynb` to train the VAE model and observe the outputs on Tensor Board for each epoch.
