# Bioinformatics Homework 1

This Jupyter notebook is part of a bioinformatics homework assignment that demonstrates data analysis and visualization techniques, particularly in the context of genomic data.

## Overview

The notebook includes steps for generating a dataset, conducting basic statistical analysis, and creating a Manhattan plot, commonly used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Load the generated CSV file into the notebook for analysis.

## Key Activities

- Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas.
- Statistical analysis and p-value calculation with SciPy and NumPy.
- Generation of a Manhattan plot for data visualization.

## Usage

Open the `Bioinformatics_HW1.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or another compatible environment and execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Additional Notes

References to external resources are made within the notebook for specific techniques, indicating areas where additional context may be needed for understanding or where the author sought clarification during development.
